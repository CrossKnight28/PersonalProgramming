        Planned Features:
        Select the amount of rounds.
        Use Thread.sleep to make the code feel a little more alive instead of going at insane speeds.
        Maybe do more than rock paper scissors, possible make this a multiple game code containing connect four, lottery winner and others.
        Organize the code better than before.
        Use more functions.
        Make it easier to read with stuff like | and ----
